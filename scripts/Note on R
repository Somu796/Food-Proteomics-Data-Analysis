1.Diff b/w pull() and select()?

First, it makes sense to see what class each function creates.

library(dplyr)

mtcars %>% pull(cyl) %>% class()
#> 'numeric'

mtcars %>% select(cyl) %>% class()
#> 'data.frame'
So pull() creates a vector -- which, in this case, is numeric -- whereas select() creates a data frame.

Basically, pull() is the equivalent to writing mtcars$cyl or mtcars[, "cyl"], whereas select() removes all of the columns except for cyl but maintains the data frame structure.

2. Why QFeaature has a limitation?
Ans. 
1. For ANOVA we need both Numerical and categorical
2. everytime we have to boil it down 

3. ad-hoc test like Levene Test, ANOVA does give you one p value for a group while, post-hoc test like shapiro wilk/ t-test gives you p value for each comparison.
